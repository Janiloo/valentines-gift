        <span>&nbsp;</span> <!-- Adds space -->
        <P>I know I’m not yet the man I want to be for you. I wish I could give you the world, spoil you with all the things you deserve, and take you on the kind of dates I know you’d love. But right now, this is all I have to offer—a simple gift, made with love.</P>
        <span>&nbsp;</span> <!-- Adds space -->
        <P>I built this website just for you, filled with flowers that I wish I could hand you in person. It may not be much, but it comes with all the love in my heart. One day, I promise, I’ll do more, give more, and show you just how much you truly mean to me. But for now, I hope this small gesture makes you smile, because seeing you happy is the greatest gift I could ever receive.</P>
        <span>&nbsp;</span> <!-- Adds space -->
        <P>I love you endlessly, now and always.</P>
        <span>&nbsp;</span> <!-- Adds space -->
        <P>Yours forever,</P>
        <P>Caff.</P>
